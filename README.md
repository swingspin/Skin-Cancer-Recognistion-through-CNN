# Introduction:

•	Cancer, it is one of the most common causes of death in the world's population. According to global statistics, about 10.0 million people would have died from cancer in 2020 (9.9 million excluding non-melanoma skin cancer).
•	Skin Cancer, this term signifies the out-of-control growth of abnormal cells in the epidermis, in the outermost layer of the skin, it is caused by unrepaired DNA damage that triggers mutations. The sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the usage of UV tanning beds are the two main causes of skin cancer. These mutations cause skin cells to grow rapidly, resulting in cancerous tumours. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma are the most common kinds of skin cancer (MCC).
•	Melanoma, it is a type of cancer that arises from melanocytes, which are skin cells that generate the pigment melanin, which gives skin its colour.
-	Melanoma is the skin cancer with the worst prognosis, Melanomas look a lot like moles and can sometimes develop from them. They can be found on any part of the body, including those not often exposed to the sun.
-	Melanomas is curable when caught and treated early, it is diagnosed based on clinical evaluation and classic features on lesion biopsy. Overall, early detection is key for the effective treatment and better outcomes these cancers.
-	The time between detection and action is critical, yet diagnosis and human error can often drag things down.
•	Nonmelanoma skin cancer encompasses all skin cancers that aren't melanoma. Nonmelanoma skin cancer encompasses a number of different forms of skin cancer, the most frequent of which are basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.


# Aim:
•	The goal of this study is to reduce the human error involved in diagnosis for biopsy by accurate recognition of images detecting the class of Skin Cancer.
•	This detection is processed by Machine Learning (ML), it is an Artificial intelligence (AI) technique that uses statistical models and algorithms to learn from data in order to anticipate the properties of fresh samples and complete a task.  Here, the complicated algorithms are designed to execute jobs that would otherwise be difficult for human brains to complete.
•	The state-of-the-art network for pattern identification in medical image analysis is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a type of machine learning that models the processing of biological neurons.


# Steps to run this project
1. **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** needs to be installed to run ipynb file in the root folder with name "CSC8635-210468180"
2. To run this project, you will need the **Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000** data set which is publicly available on https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000?select=hmnist_28_28_RGB.csv
3. Once downloaded, copy the files to **data** folder at root level.
4. Once the data files are ready, one can simply open the ipynb file and check the output on github or run the code on local or hosted Jupyter notebook.
5. If the required packages are not installed, simply uncomment the first cell which will install all the required packages for this code to run.(one time run)
5. The trained and fitted model is saved in model folder which can be directly used for evaluation and prediction using load_model function.
6. Report in pdf format can be found in root folder.
